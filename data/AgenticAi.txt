Agentic AI refers to an advanced paradigm of artificial intelligence where systems go beyond merely responding to queries or performing isolated tasks. Unlike traditional AI, which operates under predefined rules and focuses on specific tasks, agentic AI systems exhibit autonomy by actively planning, reasoning, executing complex actions, and adapting to dynamic environments with minimal human intervention.

Key Characteristics of Agentic AI
Autonomy and Proactiveness: Agentic AI operates independently, initiating and managing actions toward long-term goals rather than waiting for explicit instructions, unlike traditional AI that reacts to inputs.

Goal-Driven and Adaptive: It can set, adjust, and pursue objectives by learning from feedback and changing conditions, enabling continuous self-improvement.

Complex Decision-Making: It handles multi-step, context-aware workflows involving interaction with multiple systems and external tools, orchestrating tasks in a distributed and asynchronous manner.

Learning and Reasoning: Agentic AI refines its strategies based on experience, demonstrating advanced reasoning beyond rule-based or pattern-based responses.

Modular and Scalable: Typically involves multiple AI models collaborating, each assigned specific roles (e.g., task management, data analysis), allowing parallel processing and enhanced efficiency.

Agentic AI vs. Traditional AI
Feature	Traditional AI	Agentic AI
Autonomy	Low, responds to input only	High, acts independently and proactively
Task Scope	Narrow, task-specific	Broad, handles complex multi-step processes
Decision Making	Rule-based, deterministic	Context-aware, strategic, adaptive
Learning	Requires retraining to improve	Learns continuously from feedback
Interaction	Operates within isolated systems	Coordinates across multiple tools and APIs
Adaptability	Limited	Dynamically adapts to environment changes
Proactiveness	Reactive	Initiates actions and optimizes workflows
Agentic AI embodies a shift toward intelligent systems capable of autonomous goal achievement, complex problem-solving, and real-time adaptation, which positions it to revolutionize areas such as automation, autonomous research, and decision support systems.​
